# Competitor Intelligence System MVP - Product Requirements Document
## AI-Driven Architecture with Maximum Claude API Integration

Version: 2.0 (MVP - AI-First)  
Date: September 24, 2025  
Development Target: Few hours with Claude Code

## Executive Summary

Build an AI-first competitor intelligence system where Claude 4 drives every aspect of the application - from understanding user intent, to generating research strategies, to analyzing data, to creating actionable insights. The system maximizes Claude API usage to provide the deepest, most comprehensive competitive analysis possible.

## Core Philosophy: Claude as the Brain

Every decision, analysis, and output in this application is enhanced or driven by Claude 4. The system doesn't just use AI for analysis - it uses AI to:
- Understand user context and intent
- Plan research strategies
- Generate dynamic search queries
- Analyze every piece of data
- Make intelligent decisions about what to research next
- Synthesize insights across multiple perspectives
- Generate actionable recommendations
- Create strategic battle cards

## MVP Scope & Objectives

### What We're Building
A Next.js web application where Claude 4:
1. Analyzes uploaded documents to understand business context
2. Intelligently identifies and suggests competitors with websites
3. Creates custom research strategies based on industry and context
4. Generates dynamic search queries tailored to specific needs
5. Analyzes every search result and scraped page
6. Performs multi-pass analysis from different perspectives
7. Creates exhaustive reports with unlimited depth
8. Provides 100+ actionable recommendations

### Success Criteria
- Analyze unlimited competitors with exhaustive detail
- Generate insights that humans would miss
- Provide strategic recommendations based on deep understanding
- Extract maximum value from every data point
- Adapt research strategy based on findings
- No limits on analysis depth or processing time

## Development Approach

```bash
# Setup
npx create-next-app@latest competitor-intel-ai --typescript --tailwind --app
cd competitor-intel-ai

# Install dependencies
npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk axios cheerio pdf-parse mammoth

# Environment setup
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key" >> .env.local
echo "SERPER_API_KEY=your_key" >> .env.local
echo "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_key" >> .env.local

# Development
npm run dev
```

## Key Differentiators

1. **AI-First Architecture**: Claude drives every decision and analysis
2. **Adaptive Research**: System learns and adapts research strategy based on findings
3. **Multi-Perspective Analysis**: 10+ different analytical lenses for comprehensive insights
4. **Iterative Intelligence**: Research depth continues until Claude determines completeness
5. **Contextual Understanding**: Deep comprehension of user's business guides all analysis
6. **Intelligent Orchestration**: Claude coordinates all tools and data sources optimally
7. **Continuous Learning**: System improves based on user feedback and interactions

## Conclusion

This PRD represents a true AI-first competitive intelligence system where Claude 4 acts as the brain, making intelligent decisions at every step. The system doesn't just use AI for analysis - it uses AI to understand, plan, execute, analyze, synthesize, and recommend with unlimited depth and sophistication.

The result is a system that provides insights and recommendations that would be impossible for humans to generate manually, with a level of comprehensiveness and strategic thinking that goes far beyond traditional competitive analysis tools.
